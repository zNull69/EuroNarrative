                    <p>The EU is <strong>an organization of European countries</strong>, with 27 members out of 50 countries in Europe. It operates similarly to a nation, having its own values, flag, central bank, banknotes and coins, parliament, and court. Citizens of member countries are also called EU citizens.</p>

                        <h3>Facts and Statistics</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The EU has a population of <strong>446 million people</strong>, the third largest in the world.</li>
                            <li>The capital of the EU is <strong>Brussels</strong> (also the capital of Belgium).</li>
                            <li>The largest city is Berlin (3.7 million inhabitants).</li>

                            <li>Luxembourg is the richest country, and Bulgaria the poorest.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Flag:</strong> Features a circle of <strong>12 golden stars on a blue background</strong>, symbolizing unity, cohesion, and harmony.</li>
                        <li><strong>Motto:</strong> "<strong>United in diversity</strong>," referring to Europeans coming together for peace and prosperity while celebrating their different cultures and languages.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Early Creation</h3>
                    <p>The story begins at the end of World War II, with Europe devastated and divided by the Iron Curtain, amid rivalry between the United States and the USSR. The idea of European unity took root in the West.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>On May 9, 1950, France (through Robert Schuman) proposed Franco-German reconciliation and the placement of <strong>coal and steel</strong> production—essential for industry and weapon manufacturing—under a common authority. The goal was to revive the economy and maintain peace.</li>
                        <li>The following year, six founding countries (West Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands) signed a treaty establishing the <strong>European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)</strong>.</li>
                        <li>To accelerate development, the six founding countries signed the <strong>Treaties of Rome</strong> on March 25, 1957, which came into force in 1958. These created the <strong>European Economic Community (EEC)</strong>, aimed at establishing a <strong>common market</strong> by eliminating tariffs and allowing the free movement of workers, while defining common policies (transport, trade, agriculture). The <strong>Euratom</strong> was also created to coordinate civilian nuclear research.</li>

                    <h3>EU Values</h3>
                    <p>There are shared values among all EU countries:</p>

                            <h4>1. Human Dignity</h4>
                            <p>Respecting and valuing every person, forming the true basis of fundamental rights.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h4>2. Freedom</h4>
                            <p>Includes <strong>freedom of movement</strong> for EU citizens and freedoms such as the right to education and freedom of religion, protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.</p>

                    <p>The 27 member countries work together to solve common problems. The EU is governed by <strong>four main bodies</strong>. Initially, the institutions of the three Communities (ECSC, EEC, Euratom) were merged to function more efficiently.</p>

                    <p class="intro-text">This section focuses on the EU's major economic achievements and mechanisms for the free movement of goods, services, and people.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Single Market</h3>
                    <p>The European Single Market is a defining feature of the EU. The EEC's initial goal was to establish a common market by eliminating tariffs among member states.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>In 1986, 12 Member States signed the <strong>Single European Act</strong> to accelerate internal market development. The goal was to remove all obstacles to the free movement of people, goods, capital, and services by 1993.</li>
                        <li>The Single Market allows the EU to function as <strong>a single territory</strong> without internal barriers.</li>
                        <li>It facilitates the free movement of goods (things produced for sale), services (activities done for others, such as doctors or hairdressers), money, and people.</li>
                        <li>EU citizens have the right to live, work, study, or retire in any EU country—for example, a French teacher can teach Swedish in Sweden.</li>
                        <li>A functioning single market is one of the EU's greatest achievements, stimulating competition, improving efficiency, increasing quality, and helping lower prices. It has generated economic growth and simplified daily life while setting high safety standards. It includes 450 million consumers and 22.5 million small and medium-sized enterprises.</li>

                    <h3>The Euro and the Eurozone</h3>
                    <p>The EU has its own currency—the Euro.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>The Maastricht Treaty (1992) introduced the idea of a common currency.</li>
                        <li>The Euro was officially launched on the market in 1999, though physical banknotes and coins entered circulation only on January 1, 2002.</li>
                        <li>Today, <strong>19</strong> of the current 27 Member States use the Euro, eliminating the need for currency exchange among them. The <strong>Eurozone</strong>—the group of countries using the Euro—was established in 2005.</li>
                        <li>Countries such as Denmark and Poland do not use the Euro. The United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark chose not to adopt it.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Schengen Area</h3>
                    <p>To ensure free movement, the Schengen Area was established for residents of certain countries, including some non-EU ones.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>The Schengen Agreement, signed in 1985, was gradually implemented starting in 1995 to abolish border controls. It was incorporated into the EU by the Treaty of Amsterdam.</li>
                        <li>For residents, crossing borders does not require a visa or showing a passport.</li>
                        <li>The Schengen Area includes 26 states, including 4 non-EU members (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland). Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria, and Romania are expected to join soon.</li>

                    <h3>Early Enlargements and Consolidation</h3>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Despite French vetoes against the UK, in 1973, <strong>Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Denmark</strong> joined the Community.</li>
                        <li>In 1979, for the first time, members of the European Parliament were elected by universal suffrage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Greece</strong> joined in 1981, followed by <strong>Spain and Portugal</strong> in 1986.</li>
                        <li>In 1984, the United Kingdom obtained a reduction in its budget contribution, as Margaret Thatcher argued that Britain did not benefit enough from the Common Agricultural Policy (which represented 80% of EU spending).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>From Community to Union (Maastricht)</h3>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>The Community changed its name several times—from EEC to European Community (EC), and finally to the European Union (EU).</li>
                        <li>After the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification, the EU established contacts with Eastern European countries.</li>
                        <li>The EU was officially formed on February 7, 1992, when 12 countries signed the <strong>Maastricht Treaty</strong>. The Treaty gave new powers to the EU and launched the common currency, the Euro. The EU flag (12 stars) references the 12 signatory countries.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Further Enlargements and Treaties</h3>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>In 1995, the EU grew to 15 members with the accession of <strong>Austria, Sweden, and Finland</strong>. Switzerland and Norway rejected membership through referendums.</li>
                        <li>In 2004, 10 new countries joined the EU.</li>
                        <li>Later, the Treaty of Nice, intended to improve the Union's structure, received mixed reviews. A later attempt to create a single Constitutional Treaty was rejected by French and Dutch voters in referendums.</li>
                        <li>On January 1, 2007, <strong>Romania and Bulgaria</strong> joined.</li>
                        <li>That same year, 27 heads of state signed the <strong>Treaty of Lisbon</strong>, which entered into force in 2009. It aimed to strengthen and improve the EU's functioning after enlargement and gave it greater powers. Its purpose is also to promote peace, support sustainable development, and combat discrimination.</li>

                    <p class="intro-text">This section examines how the EU faces external pressures and key developments of the 21st century.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Response to Global Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Globalization means many problems are no longer limited to a single country, creating both opportunities and challenges.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>The EU seeks to build a common response—for instance, its trade policy creates more opportunities for businesses and gives countries greater leverage in negotiations.</li>
                        <li>The EU coordinated a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic, issuing guidelines and supporting vaccination efforts.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Economic and Financial Crisis (Post-2008)</h3>
                    <p>The global financial crisis hit the Eurozone hard, leading to recession. Many countries struggled, especially Greece, whose public debt had been concealed.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Countries such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Cyprus received financial assistance from the Eurozone and the IMF in exchange for implementing austerity measures.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Migration Crisis</h3>
                    <p>Instability (Arab Spring, wars in Syria, Libya, Iraq, and violence in the Horn of Africa) pushed many people to migrate to Europe.</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>In 2015, over one million migrants entered the Schengen area.</li>
                        <li>Europe reinforced border patrols, and some countries temporarily reintroduced border controls.</li>
                        <li>The EU signed agreements with Turkey and Libya to block illegal migration routes in exchange for financial aid.</li>
                        <li>The crisis divided European countries and fueled the rise of nationalist and Eurosceptic parties.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Brexit and the Current Situation</h3>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>In 2013, <strong>Croatia</strong> joined the European Union.</li>
                        <li>In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted in a referendum to leave the EU.</li>
                        <li>After long negotiations and numerous failures, the UK officially left the EU on <strong>January 31, 2020</strong>, becoming the first member state to do so.</li>
                        <li>Today, the European Union has <strong>27 member states</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Accession negotiations are ongoing for new members (candidate countries) such as Albania and Serbia, mainly in the Balkans. Talks with Turkey have been stalled since 2005.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p>The EU strives to face common challenges, acting as a team—like a <strong>rowing crew</strong>, where each rower represents a Member State: although each has its own strength and historical direction, the boat moves effectively only when everyone rows together, overcoming differences to reach a shared goal.</p>
